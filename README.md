# E-commerce Sales Dashboard Project Overview
## Project Objective:
The project aimed to create an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze and track the sales performance of an online store. The dashboard provides detailed insights into various sales metrics, including total revenue, profit, quantity sold, and average order value (AOV). The goal was to enable data-driven decision-making for the e-commerce business, focusing on tracking key sales trends and identifying opportunities for improvement.

## How the Project Was Done:
### Data Cleaning and Transformation:

- Raw data from the e-commerce platform was imported into Power BI using Power Query.
- Data was cleaned and standardized to ensure consistency, including removing duplicates, handling missing values, and transforming data for better usability.
### Data Modeling:

Relationships between different data tables (such as customer details, product categories, and sales transactions) were established.
New tables and calculated columns were created to perform advanced calculations like profit margin and AOV.
## Dashboard Creation:

- KPIs: Key performance indicators (KPIs) like Sum of Amount (Total Sales), Sum of Profit, Sum of Quantity Sold, and AOV were calculated and prominently displayed.
- Visualizations: A range of dynamic charts, including bar charts, coloumn charts, and donut charts, were used to display important metrics:
1. Sum of Amount by State to identify regions contributing the most to sales.
2. Sum of Quantity by Category to show which product categories are selling the most.
3. Profit by Month to track profitability trends over time.
4. Payment Mode Analysis to show customer preferences in payment options.
### Filters and Slicers:

Users can interact with the dashboard by selecting filters (e.g., by state, quarter) to drill down into specific insights and perform more granular analysis.
## Insights and Recommendations:
### Top Selling Product Category:

Clothing accounted for the highest percentage of sales (63%), indicating a strong demand for apparel in the online store. The store could focus on expanding this category, introducing more clothing options, or running promotional campaigns to maximize revenue.
  
### Geographical Insights:

Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh contributed the most to total sales. The store could explore localized marketing strategies in these regions to boost sales further, as well as assess underperforming regions like Delhi for improvement opportunities.

### Seasonality in Sales:

The "Profit by Month" visualization showed significant fluctuations, with spikes in October and December. This indicates that the business might experience seasonal sales peaks, likely around holiday seasons. A recommendation would be to prepare in advance for these months by optimizing inventory and launching targeted promotions.

### Payment Method Preferences:

Cash on Delivery (COD) accounted for the largest share of payments (44%), which indicates a high preference for COD among customers. Offering more incentives to switch to online payment methods (like discounts for credit card or UPI payments) could help reduce COD-related challenges like returns or cancellations.

### Profit by Product Sub-Category:

Printers and Bookcases contributed the most to profit among sub-categories. These items could be promoted further, or similar high-margin products could be explored.

## Recommendations for Further Analysis:
- Customer Segmentation: Analyzing customer behavior in more detail (e.g., repeat customers vs. new customers) could offer insights into retention strategies and help increase customer loyalty.
- Inventory Optimization: By linking the sales trends with stock availability, the store can better manage its inventory, ensuring that high-demand products are well-stocked, especially in peak sales months.
- Marketing Optimization: Based on regional performance and product demand, the store could run tailored marketing campaigns to boost sales in underperforming categories or regions.
